Here's a plan to enhance the accessibility testing program based on the information in the readme.txt file:

1. Prioritize WCAG criteria:
   a. Review the list of additional WCAG success criteria not currently covered by the program.
   b. Prioritize the criteria based on impact, feasibility, and importance.
   c. Consider factors like complexity, user benefit, dependencies, and project context.
   d. Create a prioritized list of criteria to guide the implementation process.

2. Breakdown of "1.1.1 Non-text Content" criterion:
   a. Identify all instances of non-text content (images, icons, charts, etc.) in the tested web pages.
   b. Check if each non-text content item has a text alternative (e.g., alt attribute for images).
   c. Evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the text alternatives.
   d. Provide recommendations for missing or insufficient text alternatives.
   e. Integrate these checks into the automated testing process.
   f. Update the reporting functionality to include information about non-text content accessibility.

3. Implementation of automated checks:
   a. Develop automated checks for the prioritized criteria, starting with "1.1.1 Non-text Content".
   b. Leverage existing libraries, write custom code, or integrate with external accessibility testing tools.
   c. Ensure the automated checks provide quick feedback and identify common issues.

4. Integration of manual testing procedures:
   a. Recognize that some accessibility criteria may require manual evaluation.
   b. Develop testing procedures and guidelines for manual accessibility testing.
   c. Include steps for keyboard navigation, visual inspection, and assistive technology usage.
   d. Document the manual testing procedures in the project's README or a separate testing guide.

5. Terminology validator update:
   a. Review the AccessibilityTerminologyValidator class.
   b. Update it to include new terms or concepts related to the additional WCAG criteria.
   c. Ensure consistent terminology usage throughout the program, aligning with WCAG guidelines.

6. Reporting functionality enhancement:
   a. Modify the report generation scripts (e.g., Enhanced_Report_Generator) to include information about the newly covered WCAG criteria.
   b. Update the report templates to provide clear explanations, examples, and recommendations for each identified accessibility issue.

7. Testing and validation:
   a. Thoroughly test the program against various web pages and scenarios.
   b. Validate the accuracy and reliability of the new checks.
   c. Ensure the program provides meaningful and actionable feedback.

8. Documentation update:
   a. Update the project's documentation, including the README file and relevant code comments.
   b. Reflect the enhancements made to the program.
   c. Clearly indicate which WCAG criteria are now covered.
   d. Provide instructions for running the updated accessibility tests.

9. Iterative approach:
   a. Implement the enhancements iteratively, focusing on the highest priority criteria first.
   b. Gradually expand the program's capabilities over time.
   c. Regularly review and update the program to stay aligned with the latest accessibility guidelines and best practices.

10. Seek guidance and ask questions:
    a. Reach out for specific questions or guidance on implementing any of the enhancements.
    b. Collaborate to improve the accessibility testing program and ensure it provides valuable insights for creating inclusive web experiences.

This plan breaks down the steps to enhance the accessibility testing program based on the information provided in the readme.txt file. It prioritizes the WCAG criteria, outlines the implementation process, and emphasizes the importance of testing, validation, documentation, and an iterative approach. The plan also encourages seeking guidance and collaboration to ensure the program's effectiveness in improving web accessibility.
